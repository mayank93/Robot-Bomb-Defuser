* Control flow
 The main game code resides in the =bombDefuser.py= file.This file first import all the required library and design.py file.
 First the intro class is called which generates the introduction screen , then by pressing different keys different screens comes.
 By pressinf 1 the game starts.Now all the remaining classes object are initallised.The robot is placed at inital position.
 Then a loop is run till the number of levels are less then particular number or life not equal to zero or flag not equal to one.
 In this loop bomb and diffuse codes are planted and enemy are generated at random places.Insides this there is another loop which 
 wait for user input for predefined interval of time. If no input is received during this period, it continues with the previous input.
 If =p or P= key is pressed it =pauses= the game by entering into a while loop which breaks when =p or P= is pressed again.A count of 
 bomb and diffuse codes is mainted when all diffuse codes are collected and then all bomb are collected the next level begins.
 Flags are set accordingly to bomb and diffuse code count.If number of life is =zero= and flag equal =1 or 2= game ends.
